                                                                                        🧩 Introduction

The Student Management & Analysis System is a modern web-based project designed to help manage and analyze student-related activities efficiently. It simplifies tasks such as managing schedules, analyzing resumes, and maintaining organized academic data — all through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

                                                                                         🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a centralized platform for students where they can:

Maintain their personal and academic records.

View and manage schedules or timetables.

Upload or analyze resumes for skill insights.

Improve productivity with a clean and responsive web interface.

                                                                                  🚨 Problem Statement

Students often face difficulties managing their multiple academic tasks, documents, and schedules in one place. Manual tracking is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to disorganization and missed deadlines.

                                                                                   💡 Proposed Solution

This project provides a web-based platform that digitizes student data handling.
It allows easy access to schedules, document analysis, and profile management through an interactive dashboard.
Using modern tools like Vite and Tailwind CSS, the system ensures both performance and visual simplicity.

                                                                                   ⚙️ Technology Stack
